# Laboratory rotation cognition

This project was done in the context of a laboratory rotation for the "cognition and knowledge" module, for my master's in cognitive science at TU Kaiserslautern.

Data analysis of a survey studying perceptions of driving styles. The data of the participants was anonymised or aggregated beforehand. Therefore there is no personal information available in this respository.

The analysis focuses on the influence of car type in the perception of driver's assertiveness/defensiveness.

Enjoy.
