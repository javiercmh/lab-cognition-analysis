# Driving styles and car type

## Introduction

Definitions:
- Driving style vs skill (Taubman-Ben-Ari & Skvirsky, 2016)
    - Skill: driver's performance. Controlling the vehicle in changing traffic situations. Can be improved with practice.
    - **Style**: choice or habits when driving. Influenced by needs and values.

Measuring driving style

{figure of 3 elements pointing at driving style}
{or maybe 3 elements with respective icons would look better}
- Self-report survey (Taubman-Ben-Ari et al., 2004; Yusof, 2019).
- Objective measurements (Hooft van Huysduynen et al., 2018): speed, acceleration, braking, steering, etc.
- External raters ()

Which driving styles are there?

It depends.

- MDSI: reckless and careless, anxious, angry and hostile, and careful and patient (Taubman-Ben-Ari et al., 2004).
- Yusof (2019): defensive, assertive, light rail transit (LRT).
- ... {leave it like that}


## Hypotheses

The present survey...

Specific objectives:
- ...
- ...

1. Defensive drivers will be rated as equally defensive disregarding car type
2. Angry/risky drivers will be rated as riskier if they drive a family car than if they drive a sports car


## Method

### Participants

_N_ = X (X female), _M_ = X, _SD_ = X) between {min} and {max}, with at least 1 year of driving experience.

### Procedure: survey

Diagram of the conditions.

Example video or screenshot.
Pictures of both cars, same colour.

Questionnaire: Yusof's "comfort rating survey". Made to rate autonomous driving preferences.

5 items in the 5-point Likert scale.
{Show items from R1-R5}
"R1, R2, and R3 asked about the opinion of the autonomous vehicle
driving behaviour with regard to comfort, pleasantness, and safety." (p. 59)

I decided to use R1-R3 for my analysis, however R1 did not apply, so we were left only with R2 and R3.
