# Driving styles review

## Introduction

Definition of Driving style. "A driving style is a set of driving habits that are used to drive a vehicle" (AI, personal communication).




Determining a driving style:
- Objective driving measures (e.g. ranges of acceleration, braking, steering)
- Self-report
- External evaluation

DS types based on Yusof.
- Defensive
- Assertive
- Light rail transit (LRT)




## Hypotheses

The present survey...

Specific objectives:
- ...
- ...

1. Defensive drivers will be rated as equally defensive disregarding car type
2. Angry/risky drivers will be rated as riskier if they drive a family car than if they drive a sports car


## Method

### Participants

_N_ = X (X female), _M_ = X, _SD_ = X) between {min} and {max}, with at least 1 year of driving experience.

### Survey

Diagram of the conditions.

Example video or screenshot.
Pictures of both cars, same colour.

Questionnaire: Yusof's "comfort rating survey". Made to rate autonomous driving preferences.

5 items in the 5-point Likert scale.
{Show items from R1-R5}
"R1, R2, and R3 asked about the opinion of the autonomous vehicle
driving behaviour with regard to comfort, pleasantness, and safety." (p. 59)

I decided to use R1-R3 for my analysis, however R1 did not apply, so we were left only with R2 and R3.
