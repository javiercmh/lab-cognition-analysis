# Driving styles and car type

## Introduction

### Driving style

Definitions:
- Driving style vs skill (Taubman-Ben-Ari & Skvirsky, 2016)
    - Skill: driver's performance. Controlling the vehicle in changing traffic situations. Can be improved with practice.
    - **Style**: choice or habits when driving. Influenced by needs and values.

Which driving styles are there?

Many.

- MDSI: reckless and careless, anxious, angry and hostile, and careful and patient (Taubman-Ben-Ari et al., 2004).
- Yusof (2019): defensive, assertive, light rail transit (LRT).
- ... {leave it like that}


Measuring driving style

{or maybe 3 elements with respective icons would look better}
- Self-report survey (Taubman-Ben-Ari et al., 2004; Yusof, 2019).
- Objective measurements (Hooft van Huysduynen et al., 2018): speed, acceleration, braking, steering, etc.
- Observer's rating (West et al., 1993)

In our study, we used focused on observer's rating of driving style, investigating the effect of other external variables or biases.

I was interested in the influence of car type on the rating of driving styles.

### Why car type?

Car types can influence in the way an observer judges the cause of car accidents (Lawrence and Richardson, 2005). 
- Aggressive car (BMW): the driver was aggressive.
- Not aggressive car (Smart): driver was careless.

Wenzel and Ross (2005) analysed fatalities by car type in a 4-year period (from 1997). {Paste figure.} Sports cars caused the most fatalities for the driver in this period. Minivans and luxury cars are on the other extreme. Consider other factors, like car weight and safety features.

According to Redshaw et al. (2008), there is a correlation between characteristics of a car and driving behaviours.

- "... I get the worst road rages in [my dad's sports car] but I think it’s because I know that I can beat that guy who’s driving a little slow car, so why not? (Female 3, Lawson)" (p. 25)


## Hypotheses

{what do I think will be the association between car type and driving style?}

We know there are sterotypes associated to different car types. Imagine we watch driving footage of two types of cars: sports car and family car (minivan). I saw 3 alternatives:

a. Sports cars are associated with more risky behaviours and accidents, so I will interpret the driving as more aggressive.
b. Because we expect the car to behave like a sports car, actual behaviour might never be sporty enough for us.
c. No association between car type and driving style ratings.

{Think about it for a moment and remember your choice.}

I chose option b.

Hypothesis:
- Car type will be associated with driving style.
- Sports cars will be rated as less aggressive than other cars.


## Method

### Participants

_N_ = X (X female), _M_ = X, _SD_ = X) between {min} and {max}, with at least 1 year of driving experience.

### Procedure: survey

Diagram of the conditions.

Example video or screenshot.
Pictures of both cars: similar number of polygons, same colour.

Questionnaire: Yusof's "comfort rating survey". Made to rate autonomous driving preferences.

5 items in the 5-point Likert scale.
{Show items from R1-R5}
"R1, R2, and R3 asked about the opinion of the autonomous vehicle
driving behaviour with regard to comfort, pleasantness, and safety." (p. 59)

I decided to use R1-R3 for my analysis, however R1 did not apply, so we were left only with R2 and R3.

## Results

eta² 0.06 = medium effect.

## Discussion

- Immersiveness of the videos: no audio, no feeling of acceleration.
