# Driving styles and car type

## Introduction

### Driving style

Definitions:
- Driving style vs skill (Taubman-Ben-Ari & Skvirsky, 2016)
    - Skill: driver's performance. Controlling the vehicle in changing traffic situations. Can be improved with practice.
    - **Style**: choice or habits when driving. Influenced by needs and values.

Which driving styles are there?

Many.

- MDSI: risky, angry, patient, careful, dissociative, anxious, high-velocity, distress-reduction (Taubman-Ben-Ari et al., 2004).
- Yusof (2019): defensive, assertive, light rail transit (LRT).
- We considered 2:
    - Aggressive: risky + angry. {driving on the limit, swearing and honking}
    - Defensive: patient + careful. {wait at the intersections, pay attention to manouvers of other drivers}

Measuring driving style

{figure of 3 elements pointing at driving style}
{or maybe 3 elements with respective icons would look better}
- Self-report survey (Taubman-Ben-Ari et al., 2004; Yusof, 2019).
- Objective measurements (Hooft van Huysduynen et al., 2018): speed, acceleration, braking, steering, etc.
- Observer's rating (West et al., 1993)

In our study, we used focused on observer's rating of driving style, investigating the effect of other external variables or biases.

I was interested in the influence of car type on the rating of driving styles.

### Why car type?

Car types can influence in the way an observer judges the cause of car accidents (Lawrence and Richardson, 2005). 
- Aggressive car (BMW): the driver was aggressive.
- Not aggressive car (Smart): driver was careless.

Wenzel and Ross (2005) analysed fatalities by car type in a 4-year period (from 1997). {Paste figure.} Sports cars caused the most fatalities for the driver in this period. Minivans and luxury cars are on the other extreme. Consider other factors, like car weight and safety features.

According to Redshaw et al. (2008), there is a correlation between characteristics of a car and driving behaviours.

- "... I get the worst road rages in [my dad's sports car] but I think it’s because I know that I can beat that guy who’s driving a little slow car, so why not? (Female 3, Lawson)" (p. 25)


## Hypotheses

{what do I think will be the association between car type and driving style?}

We know there are sterotypes associated to different car types. Imagine we watch driving footage of two types of cars: sports car and family car (minivan). I saw 3 alternatives:

a. Sports cars are associated with more risky behaviours and accidents, so I will interpret the driving as more aggressive.
b. Because we expect the car to behave like a sports car, actual behaviour might never be sporty enough for us.
c. No association between car type and driving style ratings.

{Think about it for a moment and remember your choice.}

I chose option b.

Hypothesis:
1. Ratings of driving style will correspond to the ground truth of the videos.
2. Car type will be associated with rated driving style.
2. 1. Sports cars will be rated as less aggressive than other cars.


## Method

### Participants

_N_ = 19 (10 female), ages between 21 and 59 (_M_ = 28, _SD_ = 8.3), with at least 1 year of driving experience. All but 1 had at least a bachelor's degree. They were offered participation hours.

### Procedure: survey

Basic structure:

Welcome > practice trial > 8 videos with questions > demographics and other questions.

The trials:
- Video {show video or screenshot}
- Questionnaire {show questions}

About the videos:

- Data from 12 human who drove using a driving simulator (RODOS, https://www.itwm.fraunhofer.de/en/departments/mf/technikum/rodos.html).
- 8 types of videos, 2 from each condition:
    - Car type: sports car and family car. Controlled for number of polygons and colour. {include pics}
    - Driving style based on MDSI (Taubman-Ben-Ari et al., 2004)
        - Aggressive: highest score for angry and risky categories
        - Defensive: highest scores for patient and careful driving.
    - Scenarios: both with a pedestrian crossing the road. {include pic}


About the questionnaire:

- Yusof's "comfort rating survey" (2019). Made to rate autonomous driving preferences. That's why we used it to rate driving style.
- 5 items in the 5-point Likert scale. {Show items from R1-R5}
    "R1, R2, and R3 asked about the opinion of the autonomous vehicle driving behaviour with regard to comfort, pleasantness, and safety." (p. 59)
- I decided to use R1-R3 for my analysis, however R1 did not apply, so we were left only with R2 and R3.

## Results

eta² 0.06 = medium effect.

## Discussion

- We wanted to explore the associations between driving style and car type. Although we found significant results, they were not what we expected.
- Ratings of driving styles did not seem to correspond to the groups made with self-reported driving styles.
    - Aspects of driving characterizing each style were not easy to observe in the videos (e.g. acceleration, turns, intersections, other cars, swearing, etc.).
    - Driving styles are predispositions and they are not always observed in real driving (Hooft van Huysduynen et al., 2018). Indirect effect.
- 

Limitations:
- Immersiveness of the videos: no audio, no feeling of acceleration.
- Cars were only observed from behind, maybe hard to see that it was a minivan.
- Videos too short

### Future Work

- Immersive experience, like the ones considered by Yusof (2019).
- Conditions determined by driving behaviours and not just driving styles.

## Conclusion

This study contributes to our understanding and perceptions about driving. In this survey, we learned that car type appears to influence the way we rate driving styles of people.
